      <p>
        At CalmConnect, we believe that sometimes a voice and a face can offer more comfort than words on a screen.
        That’s why we offer one-on-one video calls with trusted peer listeners who are here to support you —
        whether you’re feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or just need someone to talk to.
        Our trained team members are not professional therapists but compassionate individuals committed to listening without judgment.
        All sessions are confidential and free.
        Just choose a team member whose availability matches yours and click “Start Call” to begin a safe, supportive conversation in real time.
