            </p>

            <p>These aren’t tests—just playful prompts to uncover your thoughts and feelings.</p>

            <p><strong>Your comfort and privacy are our top priorities.</strong> There are no right or wrong answers, and every interaction is confidential. Think of this as a friendly conversation with yourself, facilitated by a few delightful challenges.</p>

            <p>The insights gained from these activities can help you and our professionals better understand areas where you might need support, or simply highlight your strengths and resilience.</p>
